      <h2>Dauphin Island, Alabama</h2>
      <p>Best Features: Least Expensive, Very Private</p>
      <p>Our many years of Gulf Coast exploring started with a few trips to Dauphin Island. It's a beautiful, quiet section of the coast. There are no monstrous condos mucking up the view. Most of the housing is a lot of bang for the buck. Because there is not much else on the island you can expect a lot of beach time, with it being mostly private. Grab your groceries on the way in. To spice in a little action, we'd plan one day where we'd take the ferry across Mobile Bay and drive in to Gulf Shores for restaurants, putt-putt, go-karts, and the souvenir shop. The only drawback to Dauphin Island is that the water is not as green and there are the occasional oil rigs off the coast. If you consider that tradeoff then Dauphin Island will give you a great beach trip filled with long-lasting memories and plenty of rare solitude.</p>

      <h2>Fort Morgan, Alabama</h2>
      <p>Best Features: Balanced Beach Privacy with Relative Access to Beach Town Fun</p>
      <p>Fort Morgan sits on the east side of Mobile Bay. Fort Morgan is a great balance of the privacy of Dauphin Island with better proxemity to the fun parts of Gulf Shores. The rental houses are slightly more expensive but still very worth it. I've found a lot of value in renting places just behind the beach access rentals. You'll save a lot of money and still keep the beach convenient for your crew to travel back and forth to the house. Amongst the Alabama coast Fort Morgan is our preferred spot.</p>

    <div id="section5">
      <h2>Gulf Shores, Alabama</h2>
      <p>Best Features: Relaxed Beach Crowd amidst Beach Town Fun</p>
      <p>While not overly crowded, the Gulf Shores beach will be great for the social among us. This will come in handy if you'd like the kids to make some fun pals or if you'd like to jump in on some pick up volleyball or beach activities. Many choices for restaurants are nearby, a few of them right on the beach. Go-karts, putt putt mini golf, and arcades make this part of the coast a lot of fun even when not directly on the beach.</p>

    <div id="section6">
      <h2>Destin, Florida</h2>
      <p>Best Features: Beautiful Water and Waves in the middle of Beach City Fun</p>
      <p>Be prepared for that emerale green water to mesmerize you for the entire week if you set your sights on Destin. There are a lot of options for places to stay here which comes with a tradeoff. If you hit the right spot with beach access then you're golden. If not then be prepared to get to the beach early to stake out your spot as you'll start to see chairs and umbrellas set out early each day for rentals that rarely get used. While Destin is one of the coolest towns to stay in we found ouselves blowing off the 'survival of the fittest' on the beach and rather enjoying a short drive to Navarre Beach and ???? State Park for the day. The city of Destin has a lot of fun in store. We really liked T'he Back Porch' and 'The Donut Hole' Restaurants.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section7">
      <h2>Santa Rosa Beach, Florida</h2>
      <p>Best Features: Beautiful Water and Waves, Easy-Going Beach Friends</p>
      <p>Santa Rosa Beach sits on the wester edge of the 30A drive along the coast. The beach is a great combination of immense beauty while also having an easy going crowd. For some reason our kids were able to make good beach pals easily here which makes the place fun for everybody. You won't find all of the wild and wacky fun along the 30A but Destin is not far from SRB.</p>
