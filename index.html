      <h2>Dauphin Island, Alabama</h2>
      <p>Best Features: Least Expensive, Very Private</p>
      <p>Our many years of Gulf Coast exploring started with a few trips to Dauphin Island. It's a beautiful, quiet section of the coast. There are no monstrous condos mucking up the view. Most of the housing is a lot of bang for the buck. Because there is not much else on the island you can expect a lot of beach time, with it being mostly private. Grab your groceries on the way in. To spice in a little action, we'd plan one day where we'd take the ferry across Mobile Bay and drive in to Gulf Shores for restaurants, putt-putt, go-karts, and the souvenir shop. The only drawback to Dauphin Island is that the water is not as green and there are the occasional oil rigs off the coast. If you consider that tradeoff then Dauphin Island will give you a great beach trip filled with long-lasting memories and plenty of rare solitude.</p>

      <h2>Fort Morgan, Alabama</h2>
      <p>Fort Morgan sits on the east side of Mobile Bay. Fort Morgan is a great balance of the privacy of Dauphin Island with better proxemity to the fun parts of Gulf Shores. The rental houses are slightly more expensive but still very worth it. I've found a lot of value in renting places just behind the beach access rentals. You'll save a lot of money and still keep the beach convenient for your crew to travel back and forth to the house. </p>
